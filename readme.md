The brute force symmetry analyzer used to be available at
(http://www.cobalt.chem.ucalgary.ca/ps/symmetry/)[S. Patchkovskii's website]. Seems like the website is down.
Here you can find a copy of the file and a make file with example that you can run by doing make example.
The example will download a 13 atom Icosahedral Lennard-Jones cluster from the (http://www-wales.ch.cam.ac.uk/CCD.html)[Cambridge Cluster Database], will format the file according to the input that symmetry.out and will run it to obtain the symmetry group of the cluster.
